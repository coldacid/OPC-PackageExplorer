# PackageExplorer

> Open XML Package Explorer

The Package Explorer utility provides the ability to open an Open XML package
and browse through the relationships and parts. It supports navigation of
embedded sub-packages and uses an object model that provides a clean
separation between the UI and the packaging model.
